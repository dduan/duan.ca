    <div itemprop="articleBody"><p>There are several ways to build dependencies for a Swift 3 project:
Swift Package Manager, Cocoapods, Carthage, etc. Many have an opinion on which
is the best choice for their projects. As a library author who want to help as
many people as possible, however, they can't ignore any of them.</p>
<p>I sometimes question the sanity of that conclusion: instead of becoming an
export in each package manager, I find myself a novice of all. Did I break
support for any of them with this project change? Is it still working on
a particular platform, say, tvOS? Can I <em>really</em> know?</p>
<p>The only way to <em>really</em> know is to verify yourself: both Cocoapods and
Carthage support four platforms -- iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS; Swift Package
Manager only works on Mac or Linux. So that's 2*4+1=9 targets. All these
targets need is have the library in question fetched and imported. Every Swift
library author should have such verification before publishing updates of
their project.</p>
<p>The steps to verify can be triggered with commands: fetch and build
dependencies, build Xcode/Swift project. To automate the process, put these
commands in a script or a Makefile. But wait, there's more! One shouldn't have
to create these dummy projects every time they create a new library. If all
these projects do is importing a library and attempt to build, they should
work for <em>any</em> library. The config in <code>Package.swift</code>/<code>Cocoapods</code>/<code>Cartfile</code>
and the <code>import</code> statements just needs some strings replaced: name of the next
library, URL for its git repository, etc. And that's a scriptable process as
well!</p>
<p>To recap, one could, in theory, copy in some dummy projects, run a command to
inject information about a new library, run another command to build all these
project, verifying that support for those package managers remain functional.</p>
<p>In reality, I have created <a href="https://github.com/dduan/DistributionTests">DistributionTests</a> and put it
on <a href="https://github.com/dduan/DistributionTests">Github</a> 😉.</p>
<p>The script <code>customize</code> requires 3 pieces of information of the library: its
import name, its git repository URL and a major version number. The assumption
here is the library generates uniformly named artifacts: the file name for
<code>.framework</code> and the name users use to import it are the same. Testing
distribution of a library is as simple as:</p>
<ol>
<li>clone the project.</li>
<li>customize the project with <code>customize</code>.</li>
<li>run <code>make</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you do step 1 and 2, include the projects in library's repository, then
only step 3 is necessary! This makes testing distribution methods trivial on
a continuous integration server.</p>
<p>Go forth and create fearlessly!</p>
