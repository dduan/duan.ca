    </nav><p>I never bothered <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Signing-Your-Work">signing</a> my git commits until Github started putting
those shiny badges on them. Since then I've encountered a problem: rebased
commits lose their hash and their signed-ness.</p>
<p>That's not a big deal for a single commit. Just run <code>git commit -S --amend --no-edit</code> after rebase. And that commit, which is at <code>HEAD</code> will have a new
hash and be signed.</p>
<p>What if we have more than one commit to rebase? My instinctive answer was sign
the one on <code>HEAD</code>, then use interactive rebase to rotate the next one on top and
sign it, repeat until each one is signed and reorder them. But that doesn't work
at all because a commit's position in history is part of its content. That means
after a commit is rebased, it and every commits following it will have a new
hash and git doesn't give us an oppurtunity to say &quot;include my signature,
please&quot;. You cannot rebase and keep the commits signed!</p>
<p>Well, that kind of sucks. But you are reading about it here, so I'd better give
you something to help, right?</p>
<p>There is, at least, one way to achieve <em>rebase and sign multiple commits</em>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Run interactive rebase: <code>git rebase -i branch</code>.</li>
<li>Mark all commits and &quot;edit&quot; or &quot;e&quot;.</li>
<li>Git now stops at every commit for you to make changes. This is an oppurtunity
to sign it! <code>git commit -S --amend --no-edit</code>, just like how you would sign
<code>HEAD</code>.</li>
<li><code>git rebase --continue</code>, move on the next commit until all every one is
edited.</li>
</ol>
<p>There's virtually nothing you cannot do with git. Hence the reputation for it's
glorious UI, ya know?</p>
