    </nav><p>It's a few weeks before WWDC, so naturallyÂ¹ it's time to try build your Swift
projects in the compiler's compatibility mode!</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Download and install a snapshot for the next major version <a href="https://swift.org/download/">on
Swift.org</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/2017/05/download-swift-snapshot.png" alt="download swift toolchain" />
<img src="/assets/2017/05/install-swift-snapshot.png" alt="install swift toolchain" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose the newly installed toolchain in Xcode.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/2017/05/choose-toolchain.png" alt="choose swift toolchain in Xcode" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ask the compiler to use compatibility mode. This means using the complier
flag <code>-swift-version X</code>, where &quot;X&quot; is the <em>current</em> major Swift version.</p>
<p>In project's &quot;Build Settings&quot;, value for &quot;Other Swift Flags&quot; should
contain <code>-swift-version X</code>. This could mean setting it in Xcode, in
<code>.xcconfig</code> files you are using and/or in your dependency managers such
as Cocoapods.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/2017/05/compat-mode-flag.png" alt="compatibility flag in xcode" /></p>
<p>For example, with Cocoapods, you'll need to add the following in your
<code>Podfile</code> to compile 3rd party libraries in compatibility mode:</p>
<pre><code> post_install do |installer|
     installer.pods_projects.targets.each do |target|
         target.build_configurations.each do |config|
             config.build_settings[&quot;OTHER_SWIFT_FLAGS&quot;] = &quot;$(inherited) -swift-version 3&quot;
         end
     end
 end
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build your project! This is where things start to get exciting.</p>
<p>You should expect some warnings. Hopefully they are self-explanatory
enough. Most of them should correspond to <a href="https://apple.github.io/swift-evolution/">a swift-evolution
proposal</a>.</p>
<p>Improvement to the language or compiler usually means some of these
warnings tell you problems in your code that has been ignored by the
compiler previously. Fix them today!</p>
<p>The project should compile successfully in compatibility mode (despite
warnings). This where you can stop reading. Go celebrate with your
coworkers, friends, and family!</p>
<p>Things could go wrong for compiler snapshots, of course. Read on if see
errors or crashes (whaaaaat ðŸ˜¸).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's time to tell the compiler team about the error or crash you encountered.</p>
<p>Reduce the error or crash to a state that your are comfortable reporting in
public. Then go to <a href="https://bugs.swift.org">bugs.swift.org</a> and file a JIRA
ticket describing the error or compiler crash.</p>
<p>During the process of code reduction you may find ways to work around the
compile error or crash. Make the changes for the workaround and repeat
steps 4-5. Maybe your project will compile this time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The issue you discovered will be fixed in the official Swift release come
fall. You've ensured a smooth Swift upgrade for your project and contributed
to the Swift community ðŸŽ‰!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>Â¹ source compatibility mode is a thing starting with Swift 4. As new
major version of Swift is released, code written in the previous version should
compile without change in compatibility mode.</p>
