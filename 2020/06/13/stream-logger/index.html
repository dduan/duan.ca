    </nav><p>After turning off stream on <a href="https://twitch.tv/daniel_duan">Twitch</a>, the first thing I normally do is
exporting the stream video to YouTube, so that the stream has an archive that
survives Twitch's short-ish retain policy.</p>
<p>These videos, perhaps surprisingly, get a few views! It's not a lot by any
measures, but I'm conscientious of the fact that a typical stream archive is
a multi-hour long video with no content curation, no clear schedule, and
it sometimes contains breaks. Needless to say, watching them after-the-fact
requires some (or a lot of) fast-forwarding.</p>
<p>So, last week <a href="https://twitch.tv/daniel_duan">on stream</a>, I set out to improve the fast-forwarding
experience. YouTube has this feature that lets you jump to specific timestamp
in the video through a URL parameter in the video' link. Further, they generate
this parameter for text in video's description, if the text is in the right
format. This is handy for generating a &quot;table of content&quot; for the video so that
viewers can click the timestamp in the description to jump to the section they
are most interested in.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/dduan/StreamLogger">StreamLogger</a> is a little utility that lets me note down what happened while
I'm streaming. It's kind of like writing a commit message, except the message
describes what happened since the last &quot;commit&quot;. These messages, along with
their associated timestamps, will be used by StreamLogger to generate the &quot;table
of content&quot;. Using it in command line looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># Turn on stream, maybe check signs of being live, etc. Then
slog start # start a new log

# Do stuff, when it comes to a natural conclusion point...
slog -- 'I did stuff'

# Do more stuff...
slog -- 'some other stuff'

# Some time later... end stream
# No action is required to end the stream as far as StreamLogger is concerned.

# Now, to generate the table-of-content
slog stamp -s 1:32
</code></pre>
<p>That last command outputs</p>
<pre><code>0:01:32 I did stuff
1:41:59 some other stuff
</code></pre>
<p>... which goes to the video's description.</p>
<p>There's a few subtleties in this overall simple tool.</p>
<p>Whenever a message is added, it gets associated with the time at which the
<em>previous</em> message was add. So the act of logging marks both the end of
a chapter and the beginning of the next.</p>
<p>In reality, there's always going to be a gap between the start of the stream and
the time the log is initialized. That's what the <code>-s 1:32</code> in the last command
is trying to correct. It tells StreamLogger the length of the gap. Now the
absolute time associated with each event has a relationship with the archive
video.</p>
<hr />
<p>I chose to write this in Rust because I'm going to need the final product on
Linux, macOS, and Windows since I stream on all 3 platforms. (fun fact: I never
built it directly on my PC running Linux. Instead, I simply downloaded the
musl-based build from the GitHub release, which was built by GitHub Actions. It
works beautifully.) Maybe one day I'll add a GUI for it that works across these
platforms, too, so that it's more friendly to wider group of users.</p>

<p>The more I use and think about StreamLogger, the more I like it. You can see
me working its entirety in the following archives ;)</p>
