    </nav><p>I noticed a lot of people are playing these two games on Twitch recently: Fall Guys and Among Us.
Personally, I think Fall Guys is a pretty fun game to play and Among Us is an entertaining game to
watch. I'm glad these games are out and popular in this strange year, even though I'm not personally
playing either frequently (perhaps that's a mistake).</p>
<p>Anyways, I want to write about this observation that, seemingly unique from me: that the in-game
characters in these two games are both blob-y, short and colorful. This similarity stuck in my head
for a while, and I'm getting increasingly anxious because those who frequently play these games
aren't making similar remarks <em>at all</em>. So, in this Sunday evening, I just had to get it out of my
head:</p>
