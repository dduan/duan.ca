# My Xcode 6.2 And 6.3 Prediction

We have a situation here: three versions of Xcode are available to devleopers as of this writing.

1. Xcode 6.1.1
2. Xcode 6.2 beta
3. Xcode 6.3 beta

6.2 is released with the purpose of making WatchKit availale.

6.3, so far, has been focused on Swift 1.2 and new Objective-C features, and a
few non-language related features.

The fact that there are two betas indicates to me each will be followed up by
an official release. So how?

My guess: there will be an official Xcode 6.2 release after Watch release. It doesn't make much sense to skip a minor version.

Then things get interesting. Watch is coming out in April. Shortly after that, we'll have WWDC. Usually, WWDC comes with major Xcode beta release. So ... what happens to version 6.3?

My guess: either we'll never get Xcode 6.3, or we won't get Xcode 7 this year.

The former make sense in the context that [Apple Is Focused on Stablity](http://9to5mac.com/2015/02/09/apples-ios-9-to-have-huge-stability-and-optimization-focus-after-years-of-feature-additions/). Xcode needs some love on that front, let's face it!

On the other hand, no harm would be done if Apple market 6.3 as version 7 come WWDC. Afterall, Swift 1.2 is significant enough to justify a major version.
