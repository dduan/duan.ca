Planning, recording and editing a video is something I find very enjoyable to
do. However, I enjoy just working on stuff as well. So I'll occassionally post
videos of me doing just that: writing code, mumbling, with all my verbal ticks
and bad habits left unedited. Not sure who these videos are for but why the heck
not, amiright?

The first one was scheduled to publish today, so I guess I should post something
about it.
