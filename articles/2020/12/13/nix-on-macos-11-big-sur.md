*Note: as of Feburary, 2022, the steps written below has been incorporated by the official Nix install script for macOS. This article is, therefore, obsolete.*

Here are the steps for installing nix on macOS 11 Big Sur.

### Preparation

Decide on which disk the nix store is to be installed. By end of this process, you'll have a disk
name like `disk4`.

Personally, I like looking it up in the Disk Utility app:

You can also use other methods, such us the `diskutil list` command.

Have this disk name ready.

### Installation

#### 1. Create the path `/nix` the macOS way.

Edit or create the file `/etc/synthetic.conf`, adding this line:

```
nix
```

Reboot the Mac.

#### 2. Create a APFS volume for the nix store.

```
sudo diskutil apfs addVolume diskX APFS 'Nix Store' -mountpoint /nix
```

Make sure to replace `diskX` with the disk you identified in the preparation step.

#### 3. Mount the volume.

Edit or create the file `/etc/fstab`, adding this line:

```
LABEL=Nix\040Store /nix apfs rw,nobrowse
```

Reboot the Mac.

#### 4. Install Nix the "normal" way

```
sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install)
```

#### 5. You are done! Try it out. I ran this little [example] as a test and things appears to work as expected.

### Bonus: using Nix in Fish shell

As a fish user, I'm used to fixing things up myself since software from non-fish users usually
pretends fish doesn't exist. Anyways, in the final steps of its installation, Nix sets up a few
environment variables in a bash script. I've adapted these specifically for fish on macOS. Add these
to your config.fish:

```
set -x NIX_PROFILES "/nix/var/nix/profiles/default $HOME/.nix-profile"
set -x NIX_SSL_CERT_FILE "$HOME/.nix-profile/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt"
set -x NIX_PATH /nix $HOME/.nix-defexpr/channels
set -x PATH $HOME/.nix-profile/bin $PATH
```

It shouldn't be to hard to do this on other OSes. The relevant information is in
`~/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh`.
