                <title>Distribution Tests</title>
                <description>&#60;p&#62;There are several ways to build dependencies for a Swift 3 project:
Swift Package Manager, Cocoapods, Carthage, etc. Many have an opinion on which
is the best choice for their projects. As a library author who want to help as
many people as possible, however, they can&#39;t ignore any of them.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;I sometimes question the sanity of that conclusion: instead of becoming an
export in each package manager, I find myself a novice of all. Did I break
support for any of them with this project change? Is it still working on
a particular platform, say, tvOS? Can I &#60;em&#62;really&#60;/em&#62; know?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The only way to &#60;em&#62;really&#60;/em&#62; know is to verify yourself: both Cocoapods and
Carthage support four platforms -- iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS; Swift Package
Manager only works on Mac or Linux. So that&#39;s 2*4+1=9 targets. All these
targets need is have the library in question fetched and imported. Every Swift
library author should have such verification before publishing updates of
their project.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The steps to verify can be triggered with commands: fetch and build
dependencies, build Xcode/Swift project. To automate the process, put these
commands in a script or a Makefile. But wait, there&#39;s more! One shouldn&#39;t have
to create these dummy projects every time they create a new library. If all
these projects do is importing a library and attempt to build, they should
work for &#60;em&#62;any&#60;/em&#62; library. The config in &#60;code&#62;Package.swift&#60;/code&#62;/&#60;code&#62;Cocoapods&#60;/code&#62;/&#60;code&#62;Cartfile&#60;/code&#62;
and the &#60;code&#62;import&#60;/code&#62; statements just needs some strings replaced: name of the next
library, URL for its git repository, etc. And that&#39;s a scriptable process as
well!&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;To recap, one could, in theory, copy in some dummy projects, run a command to
inject information about a new library, run another command to build all these
project, verifying that support for those package managers remain functional.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;In reality, I have created &#60;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dduan/DistributionTests&#34;&#62;DistributionTests&#60;/a&#62; and put it
on &#60;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dduan/DistributionTests&#34;&#62;Github&#60;/a&#62; 😉.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;The script &#60;code&#62;customize&#60;/code&#62; requires 3 pieces of information of the library: its
import name, its git repository URL and a major version number. The assumption
here is the library generates uniformly named artifacts: the file name for
&#60;code&#62;.framework&#60;/code&#62; and the name users use to import it are the same. Testing
distribution of a library is as simple as:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;ol&#62;
&#60;li&#62;clone the project.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;customize the project with &#60;code&#62;customize&#60;/code&#62;.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;run &#60;code&#62;make&#60;/code&#62;.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ol&#62;
&#60;p&#62;If you do step 1 and 2, include the projects in library&#39;s repository, then
only step 3 is necessary! This makes testing distribution methods trivial on
a continuous integration server.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Go forth and create fearlessly!&#60;/p&#62;
