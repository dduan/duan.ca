                <title>Control</title>
                <description>&#60;p&#62;For whatever reason, a dialogue from the Matrix trilogy stuck with me. I&#39;ve never heard anyone else talk
about these quotes. Maybe they aren&#39;t that deep and I have been over-projecting meanings. Anyways, Neo (&#60;strong&#62;N&#60;/strong&#62;)
and Councillor Hamann (&#60;strong&#62;H&#60;/strong&#62;) are in the last human city Zion, looking at a vast array of machines. They had
this exchange about &#60;em&#62;control&#60;/em&#62;:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;blockquote&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;H&#60;/strong&#62;: Down here, sometimes I think about all those people still plugged into the Matrix and when I look at these machines I can&#39;t help thinking that in a way we are plugged into them.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;N&#60;/strong&#62;: But we control these machines; they don&#39;t control us.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;H&#60;/strong&#62;: Of course not. How could they? The idea is pure nonsense. But… it does make one wonder… just… what is control?&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;N&#60;/strong&#62;: &#60;em&#62;If we wanted, we could shut these machines down.&#60;/em&#62;&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;H&#60;/strong&#62;: Of course. That&#39;s it. You hit it. That&#39;s control, isn&#39;t it? If we wanted we could smash them to bits. Although, if we did, we&#39;d have to consider what would happen to our lights, our heat, our air…&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;/blockquote&#62;
&#60;p&#62;It is scary how often this definition of (lack of) control applies in life.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Figured I&#39;d share.&#60;/p&#62;
