                <title>Padding a Squircle in FreeCAD 1.0</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I bought a 3D printer, and, as a result, got into 3D modeling recently. I&#x27;m still super new to everything. From experience, this means I should write down things I&#x27;m learning. The beginner&#x27;s perspective is valuable to other beginners!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squircle&quot;&gt;squircle&lt;/a&gt; is a square who&#x27;s corners are replaced by curves with g3 continuity, which can be thought of as &lt;em&gt;really hecking smooth&lt;/em&gt; curves where the derivatives of the curve must also be smooth. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freecad.org/&quot;&gt;FreeCAD&lt;/a&gt; 1.0.x, it&#x27;s not immediately obvious how to sketch such a shape, in order to create solid shapes out of it. With the help of ChatGPT, and the internet, I figured out a somewhat cohesive way to do this recently. Now I need to write it down lest I forget!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2025/06/squircle-00-finished.png&quot; alt=&quot;Finished 3D shape with a squircle front profile&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to have a sketch of a squircle that we can use to pad or pocket to create 3D shapes. In the sketch, we want to first create the sides of the square that&#x27;s straight, and connect them with the g3 curve, which can be done via the Curves workbench.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But first, let&#x27;s break down the squircle&#x27;s geometry a bit. A squircel is both a square and a circle. Each side of the square has a straight line, it ends at a specific point, let&#x27;s call it &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;, where the curve of the circle begins. From this point, if you draw a line perpendicluar to the straight part, and repeatly draw it on every such point, the new lines will intercect at point &lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;. The length of the line &lt;strong&gt;AB&lt;/strong&gt; is the &lt;em&gt;radius&lt;/em&gt; of the squircle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2025/06/squircle-01-radius.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image illustrating the radius of a squircle&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In FreeCAD, we want to include these &lt;strong&gt;AB&lt;/strong&gt; lines as guides. They will define both the straight lines on the side, as well as the correct space for the curves. The guide lines and the sides will form a cross shape. Make sure everything is symmetrical, and the &lt;strong&gt;AB&lt;/strong&gt; lines all have the same size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2025/06/squircle-02-sketch-cross-shape.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of the FreeCAD sketch of a cross outline&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the &lt;strong&gt;AB&lt;/strong&gt; lines are in construction mode represented by dashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exit the Sketch. Switch to the Curves workbench, and select 2 of the 4 concrete edges from the sketch. Use the Blend Curve option from the workbench. And you&#x27;ll get some funky looking curves connecting the straight lines, and it&#x27;s represented by a &amp;quot;Blend_Curve&amp;quot; in the object tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2025/06/squircle-03-curve-unfixed.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of adding the blend curve&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Select the &amp;quot;Blend_Curve&amp;quot; in the tree and tweak its Data fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set &lt;code&gt;Auto Scale&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set &lt;code&gt;Parameter&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;0mm&lt;/code&gt; for both edges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The new curve should smoothely connect with the ends of the sides that&#x27;s close to the other straight side. If not, set &lt;code&gt;Reverse&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most importantly, set &lt;code&gt;Continuity&lt;/code&gt; for both edges to &lt;code&gt;G3&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2025/06/squircle-04-curve-fixed.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of fixed blend curve&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That completes 1 of the 4 corners. Repeat for the other 3. And now you have a 2D squircle!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There should be 4 &amp;quot;Blend_Curve&amp;quot;s in the object tree, as well as the original sketch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now things get a little convoluted. Although things on screen look like a closed wire, we can&#x27;t use it to create a 3D shape for 2 reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &amp;quot;Blend_Curve&amp;quot;s aren&#x27;t part of any body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the curves and the straights don&#x27;t belong to the same geometry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#x27;s a easy way to fix both problems, thanks to the fact that multiple shapes in FreeCAD 1.0 can comine into a single sub-objects shape binder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switch back to the Part Design workbench. Activate the body you want the final 3D shape in (can be an existing or new body). Select all 4 blend curves in the object tree, and the sketch. You should see the entire wire highlighted in a uniform color. Then use the sub-objects shape binder tool, which gets you a single binder in the tree of the active body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should see the binder on screen. Hide other things if they are distracting you. Now, select the edges in the binder -- all 8 of them! After that, you can use the Pad tool to create a 3D shape. And that&#x27;s it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, a squircle is the simpliest shape to incorporate a g3 continous curve. But once we have the curve as a wire, anything is possible in FreeCAD.&lt;/p&gt;
