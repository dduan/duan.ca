                <title>Fall Guys are Among Us</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I noticed a lot of people are playing these two games on Twitch recently: Fall Guys and Among Us.
Personally, I think Fall Guys is a pretty fun game to play and Among Us is an entertaining game to
watch. I&#x27;m glad these games are out and popular in this strange year, even though I&#x27;m not
playing either frequently (perhaps that&#x27;s a mistake).&lt;&#x2f;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I want to write about this observation that seems unique from me: that the in-game
characters in these two games are both blob-y, short and colorful. This similarity stuck in my head
for a while, and I&#x27;m getting increasingly anxious because those who frequently play these games
aren&#x27;t making similar remarks &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;&#x2f;em&gt;. So, in this Sunday evening, I just had to get it out of my
head:&lt;&#x2f;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This animation is made from Pixelmator and Keynote. Those two along with Sketch and Final Cut Pro
make me feel invincible these days.&lt;&#x2f;p&gt;
