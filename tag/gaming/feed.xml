                <title>Fall Guys are Among Us</title>
                <description>&#60;p&#62;I noticed a lot of people are playing these two games on Twitch recently: Fall Guys and Among Us.
Personally, I think Fall Guys is a pretty fun game to play and Among Us is an entertaining game to
watch. I&#39;m glad these games are out and popular in this strange year, even though I&#39;m not
playing either frequently (perhaps that&#39;s a mistake).&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;Anyways, I want to write about this observation that seems unique from me: that the in-game
characters in these two games are both blob-y, short and colorful. This similarity stuck in my head
for a while, and I&#39;m getting increasingly anxious because those who frequently play these games
aren&#39;t making similar remarks &#60;em&#62;at all&#60;/em&#62;. So, in this Sunday evening, I just had to get it out of my
head:&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;video id=&#34;video-tag&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; autoplay muted loop playsinline&#62; 
    &#60;source src=&#34;/assets/2020/08/FallGuysAmongUs.mov&#34; type=&#34;video/quicktime&#34; /&#62;  
&#60;/video&#62;
&#60;img id=&#34;img-tag&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; src=&#34;/assets/2020/08/FallGuysAmongUs.mov&#34;&#62;
&#60;script type=&#34;text/javascript&#34;&#62;
    function BrowserDetection() {
        //Check if browser is Safari, if it is, hide the &#60;video&#62; tag, otherwise hide the &#60;img&#62; tag
        if (navigator.userAgent.search(&#34;Safari&#34;) &#62;= 0 &#38;&#38; navigator.userAgent.search(&#34;Chrome&#34;) &#60; 0) {
            document.getElementById(&#39;video-tag&#39;).style.display= &#34;none&#34;;
        } else {
            document.getElementById(&#39;img-tag&#39;).style.display= &#34;none&#34;;
        }
    }

    //And run the script. Note that the script tag needs to be run after HTML so where you place it is important. 
    BrowserDetection();
&#60;/script&#62;
&#60;p&#62;This animation is made from Pixelmator and Keynote. Those two along with Sketch and Final Cut Pro
make me feel invincible these days.&#60;/p&#62;
